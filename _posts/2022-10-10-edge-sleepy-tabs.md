# Microsoft Edge Browser Sleepy Tabs

I've been using the new(ish) Microsoft Edge Browser for the last couple months, and I must admit I like it more than the competition due its performance and power consumption.

However, I've been having trouble with using Microsoft Teams for Web within this browser due to one of the performance and power saving features: **Sleeping Tabs**.

This feature frees up resources for a tab I have not interacted with in the last two hours, pausing notifications from my MS Teams tab. This is of course a huge problem, because I need to be always available on Teams during work hours, and I've missed about a dozen messages as a result. But no longer, for I have found the solution to my problem.
