# Launching Windows Programs from WSL

Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2) supports launching any Windows application exe and will automatically convert . to a Windows path.

So, for instance, I like using GitExtensions to manage my git repository, and in a Windows terminal I can open the current repository in GitExtensions by simply typing `gitex` and pressing enter. To get this functionality in the WSL I had to create an alias:

```bash
alias gitex="'/mnt/c/Program Files (x86)/GitExtensions/GitExtensions.exe' . &"
```

> Note: I had to add the `.` on the end, because selecting the current path would normally be handled by gitex.cmd. It also would run the program in the background, allowing me to continue using my terminal session; hence the `&` at the end.

## Make it Permanent

An aliase is only for the current shell session. To make it "permanent", we need to append it to **~/.bashrc**.

I did that by simply openging .bashrc with vim and adding it to the end:
1. `vi ~/.bashrc`
2. Shift+G
3. Shift+O
4. Right-Click
5. `:x`
