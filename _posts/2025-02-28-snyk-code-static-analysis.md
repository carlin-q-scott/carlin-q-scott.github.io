# Snyk Code Static Analysis and Custom SQL Injection Mitigation in C#

When using Snyk Code static analysis to detect SQL injection vulnerabilities in C#, it is important to note that Snyk Code won't detect a custom SQL injection mitigation that validates dynamic column names against a Regex unless there is a local Regex variable declaration. The actual Regex can be statically defined elsewhere, but there needs to be a local reference to it in order for Snyk to detect that attack vectors were successfully mitigated.

## Example Code

Here is an example of the code that demonstrates the issue:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Data.SqlClient;
using System.Text.RegularExpressions;

public class SqlInjectionMitigation
{
    private static readonly Regex ColumnNameRegex = new Regex("^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$");

    public void ExecuteQuery(string columnName)
    {
        if (!ColumnNameRegex.IsMatch(columnName))
        {
            throw new ArgumentException("Invalid column name");
        }

        string query = $"SELECT {columnName} FROM Users";
        using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection("your_connection_string"))
        {
            SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand(query, connection);
            connection.Open();
            SqlDataReader reader = command.ExecuteReader();
            while (reader.Read())
            {
                Console.WriteLine(reader[0]);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In the above code, the `ColumnNameRegex` is defined as a static readonly field. However, Snyk Code static analysis won't detect the custom SQL injection mitigation because there is no local Regex variable declaration.

## Solution

To ensure that Snyk Code detects the custom SQL injection mitigation, you need to add a local Regex variable declaration. Here is the modified code:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Data.SqlClient;
using System.Text.RegularExpressions;

public class SqlInjectionMitigation
{
    private static readonly Regex ColumnNameRegex = new Regex("^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$");

    public void ExecuteQuery(string columnName)
    {
        // Local Regex variable declaration
        Regex localColumnNameRegex = ColumnNameRegex;

        if (!localColumnNameRegex.IsMatch(columnName))
        {
            throw new ArgumentException("Invalid column name");
        }

        string query = $"SELECT {columnName} FROM Users";
        using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection("your_connection_string"))
        {
            SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand(query, connection);
            connection.Open();
            SqlDataReader reader = command.ExecuteReader();
            while (reader.Read())
            {
                Console.WriteLine(reader[0]);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

By adding the local Regex variable declaration `Regex localColumnNameRegex = ColumnNameRegex;`, Snyk Code static analysis will now detect the custom SQL injection mitigation and recognize that the attack vectors have been successfully mitigated.
